# SVG Fundamentals

> Learning SVG with Pluralsight

## Intro

Scalable vector graphics.

Can create with Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, or Inkscape.

Can also create by hand. For example, `circle` element takes `cx`, centerpoint along x axis,
`cy` centerpoint along y axis, and `r` radius.

By default, all SVG elements are colored black. To change this, add `fill` attribute.
